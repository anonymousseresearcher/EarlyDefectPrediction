the insight's close time. This led a case such as insight.Period == 20days
to step 20days worth of tradable minutes (assuming minute data resolution),
yielding a close time that was very far in the future.

We also add different means of specifying an insight's period/close time:
1. Specify insight period as a TimeSpan and we compute close time
2. Specify insight period and a resolution and bar count and we compute close time
3. Specify insight close time local directly and we compute the insight period

The key here is maintaining consistency between the three different approaches
which is heavily validated with the corresponding unit tests.

Edits also made to trust the insight's close time as the analysis end time in
the case where the analysis period == insight period (extra analysis period = 0).
Given the current setup (extra analysis period == 0), this guarantees that close
and analysis end times are equivalent.

Regression statistics were updated and expectedly we get many more insights that
have completed analysis, and as such, average scores have also changed.

the portfolio construction model were the originals (uncopied) and then copies
that are sent into the event are then piped to the insight manager/alpha handler
for scoring, so interestingly, the scoring remained the same so regression tests
continued to pass because no types were written with a dependency on that data
other than the scoring, which as mentioned, got the copies with the correct times.
A recent change made use of this time and showcases this heinous bug in all its
glory.

This refactoring overrides the event invocator and seals the method to force
derived types to use the event handler, thereby guaranteeing that the event is
always invoked AFTER the generated/close times are properly set, also ensuring
that the copy is performed after the times are set as well.

the fine data was being read using UTC time stamps which led to even
more confusion here -- this change resolves both issues.

was helpful. The removed implementation hinged on the thinking that the construction
model would be emitting targets as quantities of cash and not quantities of virtual
positions. A previous commit added a warning message for cash modelling and this
commit removes a (bad) attempt at making cash modelling work as expected. For now,
if you want to use cash modelling with the algorithm framework, careful thought will
need to be applied to the implementation of the portofio construction model AND the
execution model. They'll each need to be speaking on the same terms. As of this point,
we're unsure of a means to address all concerns, and so are leaving it as a warning
message coupled with decent documentation in the commit history regarding our
discussions/thoughts on the topics.

Again, the key for cash modelling working properly is just that the portfolio
construction model and the execution model agree on what each target means and
also agree on how virual positions vs currency balances are handled and managed.

One constant issue is that our primary cash brokerage, GDAX, doesn't support
the concept of virtual positions. Another issue is the very concept of a
vitual position. In cash modelling, there are no virtual positions, just
currencies. In this model an issue is how do we phrase portfolio targets.
For example, if I emit a target of 10 BTC/USD but don't own an USD, what
does that mean? I might have millions of dollars of LTC, but since I don't
own any USD I won't be able to execute on BTC/USD. A smart algorithm might
sell some LTC for BTC instead. At this point, we're getting into the nitty
gritty of an individual algorithm and how that algorithm might transition
between various currencies. The framewor absolutely supports these types of
things, but it requires agreement between the portfolio construction model
and the execution model as to exactly what a target is describing. In the
margin world, a target on BTC/USD simply means to change your virtual
position in that currency pair, but in the cash world, I could see it meaning
a direct amount of BTC (or USD depending on target direction +/-).

TL;DR -- Add a warning describing potentially unexpected behavior with the
open source models as written.

is not an outstanding portfolio target for that security that hasn't been
reached yet. A common pattern is (or should be) in the portfolio construction
model's OnSecuritiesChanged, emit a zero portfolio target for that security to
instruct the execution model to liquidate any holdings. Since the execution
model might not submit an order immediately, we need to be sure not to remove
the data subscription in UniverseSelection.ApplyUniverseSelection until we're
sure that the zero target has been reached.

In support of this, we've added the target to the security's holding class an
update it as part of the framework infrastructure. The universe selection
infrastructure can then query the security's current target to ensure that it
either doesn't have one (null) or that it is a zero target. This new condition,
coupled with the existing conditions (no holdings/no open orders) is sufficient
to guarantee that we're not removing security data subscriptions while they're
still needed by framework modules.

NOTE: This implementation was written under the assumption of using margin based
accounting and NOT cash modelling. We'll possibly need to revist these checks
when we move to fully support cash modelling within framework algorithms. The
next commit will prevent the VWAP/STD execution models from even attempting to
work under cash modelling.

too quickly, thereby preventing user code from being able to configure the
security object properly. Specifically, users were having an issue setting
the data normalization mode of options and underlying equity securities. By
the time the user code had set the data mode, the data feed had already
created a subscription and began processing it, so the changes were never
seen in the data feed.

This change moves all security/universe changes into pending lists and at
the end of the time step applies those changes. Security objects are still
added directly to the SecurityManager for instance access, but we delay in
adding the security to the universe and the universe to the UniverseManager.
Once added to the universe manager, an event is fired and the data feed will
process the new subscriptions.

produces insights. From this we have things like IAlphaModel, which is the model
defining how insights are produced. We have IAlphaHandler, which defines how the
insights from a single 'alpha' (the algorithm) are managed, analyzed, and stored.

InsightScore relate directly to exactly 1 insight. The distinction between the
two became more clear as we developed the insights API, and from that effort it
was decided to harmonize alpha/insight terminology across the various QC systems.

from ocurring outside of market hours. This breaks down when using multiple
security type with different market hours and caused fills to be generated
outside of market hours using the closing price from the previous day.

This change now explicitly checks to confirm that the market is open before
creating the order fill. Also, this change allows limit/stop limit orders to
fill in pre/post market but forces market/stop market orders to only fill
within normal market hours. This behavior can be brokerage specific (some
allow pre/post market trading, others do not) and as such, a brokerage model
can define it's own fill model to use to alter the default behavior
described here.

The changes to the LimitFillRegressionAlgorithm are due removing out of
market fills.

The changes to SecurityTransactionModelTests are to properly set the start
and end times of the trade bar data used when setting the market price. This
allows us to properly check market hours.

is far more complicated and requires an external data source to be properly modeled.
Some things to consider are handling a split event before all the contracts from the
previous split event have expired.

With respect to the holdings, I think a more generic method to rewrite the holdings
would be beneficial when we have the data, but it isn't as simple as applying a split
factor. During splits and other corporate events, the OCC will rewrite the options
conract such that you are 'made whole'. Sometimes this involves adjusting the contract
multiplier away from the default 100 (or 10 for minis). Another fairly common case
(especially with M&A's) is to have part of the contract paid out in cash. So it's
possible for pretty much every value in the contract/holdings to change:

	1. Multipler
	2. Strike Price
	3. Number of contracts held
	4. Cash payout in leiu of fractional stock
	5. Constant cash payout

end up in a different 'bucket' on backtest B due to a different guid. The concurrency isn't

by the AlphaManager. The actual events were removed in favor of a interface to
handle the events. This removes the need to wire events and instead just pass the
extensions to the alph manager and it will handle invoking the extensions at the
appropriate time.

This change removes all charting and statistics aggregation logic from the alpha
handler and moves it into dedicated types, AlphaChartingManagerExtension and
AlphaStatisticsManagerExtension. The resulting types are highly decoupled from the
LEAN ecosystem allowing them to be easily unit tested, whereas before the logic
was embedded in a handler with many many dependencies which would be very hard to
properly unit test.

As part of this change (and in preparation for moving scoring to the alpha thread)
the resolution of SecurityValues was removed from the alpha manager. In this new
pattern, the alpha manager is pushed generated alphas and security values at each
time step.

signals. The analysis of signals is mainly performed via ISignalScoreFunction which
computes scores for a signal. The SignalAnalysisContext provides contextual information
regarding the analysis of a particular signal object and also allows for the storing
of arbitrary state by consumers -- scoring functions can benefit greatly from having
this state tracked (consider any iterative function, or maybe just some heavy calcs to
be persisted between function invocations).

The enumeration ordering for different symbols is not an issue, but the order of configs for the same symbol can cause non-deterministic backtest results (only security types with multiple data types per subscription are affected such as Crypto, Futures, Options). This random behavior was observed with the FractionalQuantityRegressionAlgorithm, so the regression statistics have also been updated.

possible for two different universes to create the SAME security at

only one of them being added. Ironically, it appears that it was a last
in wins situation.

This change aims to track securities that are created by a universe in a
given time step and re-use the already created security. A more holistic
solution here may be to encapsulate the creation/fetching of securities
into a new type and then ensure we use that abstraction everywhere, but
this would have led to many more changes.

Remove auto-pinging

My hunch is that the server will do it's own which will cause the
reconnection logic to work as expected. Currently it constantly
thinks we're not connected because we're pinging the server, so
therefore it doesn't ping at the heartbeat interval.

* Dont reconnect if we're still connected

* Check if connection is open before starting reconnect logic

* Force ping on each connecton monitor time loop

* Log null response in GetAccountHoldings

Add supported crypto currencies as conversion feeds

This list is used to try and figure out what data subscription is needed
to provide the algorithm with currency feeds to support various currencies
and securities quoted in various currencies.

The previous work around required the user to explicitly add these feeds,
but now the system will resolve them even if the security isn't explicitly
added to the algorithm

* DEBUG: Log response for market orders

* More logging

* DEBUG: Heartbeat logging... does the server do it for you?

* Disable gdax

* Stream locker

Fixed order direction issue

Fix resolution of crypto currency pairs

This change splits out the various currency lists by security type.
This is not ideal, but it does remove the special case checking for
cfds in the cash method and makes it explicit what security type to
use when constructing symbol objects.

* Add EUR crypto pairs

* Fix broken tests, add some crpyto currency symbols

Account holdings loading from GDAX

Don't model holdings, use empty list

* Remove throw as we can add cash another way

* Fix failing unit tests

* Remove subscription requirement from Cash.EnsureCurrencyDataFeed

We're now passing in the default markets per security type so we no longer require
subscriptions to be added before adding currency conversion feeds.

* Log everything coming through web socket

* Fix duplicate messages in BaseWebsocketsBrokerage

This issue was caused by event handlers being attached twice, due to Connect being called twice (by BrokerageHistoryProvider and BrokerageSetupHandler)

* Remove Log.Trace from WebSocketWrapper.OnMessage

* Remove GDAX maintenance error message

* Restore WebSocketWrapper.OnMessage log trace

* Remove change log

* Clean white space, remove unused member

- it didn't include fees for orders partially filled, then cancelled
- it couldn't calculate fees for orders sent to financial advisor groups/profiles

Now every OrderEvent fired (for total or partial fills) will only include the actual IB fee paid for each single execution.

Order fill handling logic has also been simplified by only processing fills in the IB ExecutionDetails and CommissionReport events, instead of OrderStatusChanged (which can fire multiple times or not at all in some cases, such as market orders executed immediately).

->There are not guaranteed to be orderStatus callbacks for every change in order status. For example with market orders when the order is accepted and executes immediately, there commonly will not be any corresponding orderStatus callbacks. For that reason it is recommended to monitor the IBApi.EWrapper.execDetails function in addition to IBApi.EWrapper.orderStatus.

This PR now handles both callbacks, when monitoring fill order events.

For example, Forex backtests using OandaBrokerageModel will report fees calculated with the default fee model (Oanda fees are spread-based, so they should always be reported as zero).

In this PR, SetBrokerageModel now calls SecurityInitializer.Initialize on all securities added before SetBrokerageModel is called.

Fees will be calculated using the correct fee models and the order of the calls in algorithm Initialize is now irrelevant.

- Added a new BrokerageHistoryProvider, to be used in live mode with all brokerages
- Removed IHistoryProvider implementations from IB, Oanda, FXCM brokerages
- Added new GetHistory(request) method to IBrokerage interface and implementations
- Moved CreateSliceEnumerableFromSubscriptions method from SubscriptionDataReaderHistoryProvider to the new abstract base class SynchronizingHistoryProvider, to enable reuse in BrokerageHistoryProvider

Changing the ExistingSessionDetectedAction setting from 'manual' to 'secondary', IBController will automatically click the ""Exit Application"" button and TWS will close immediately.

In this PR, we try to detect the fact that the button has been clicked by reading the IBController log file, so we can log a message and avoid retrying connection.

DataCacheProvider.  It's purpose is to define a method for caching data
files.  Currently, most data files are either read from disc or retrieved
remotely. The IDataChceProvider returns returns a Stream and can handle
many types of data. The IDataFileCacheProvider is needed because keeping data in memory will improve performance and overcome certain File read/write limitations (such as sharing violations) currently experienced by Lean.

There are two implementations of this interface.  The first is the
SingleZipEntryDataCache.  This is the default implementation. It does not
cache and returns the first entry found within a ZipFile.  The second is
the ZipEntryCacheProvider.  This is a rework of the existing
DataCachePrivider.  It caches ZipFiles for up to 10 seconds.  It can
return specific entries for option and future ZipFiles.  Otherwise, it
returns the first entry in a ZipFile.

Added IDataFileCacheProvider as parameter to IHistoryProvider.Initialize()

The IDataFileCacheProvider is very useful for the IHistoryProvider in that it can eliminate the need for history request to touch disc.  This can greatly improve peerformance and eliminate disc bugs associated with disc read/writes. To minimize changes throughtout Lean, the default value for the IDataFileCacheProvider is null in the IHistoryProvider.Initialize method.

IDataCacheProviders are passed down the Lean stack. Each instance of a Subscription Enumerator factory decides what cache it
will use.  In other words, the IDataCacheProvider is not configurable from
config.json.  The IDataCacheProvider is passwed down the stack form the
Enumerator factory to the IStreamReader where it is used to retrieve data.

Added useful helper method to Unizp files into a Stream.

Following the pattern in TradeBar.Reader(), the QuoteBar.Reader() method will now swallow a parsing error, log the error message and line number and then proced to return a default instance of Quotebar.  The current implementation of QuoteBar.Reader() will stop the executation of the program if a parsing error is found.  Given the amount of data Lean may parse during the execuation of an algorithm, it is better to be resiliant to small errors in the data than to stop the execuation of the program because of a malformated line of csv.

* Added QuoteBar.Reader tests

* Minor changes to config.json; back to proper defaults

Remove QLLib.NET reference

Added date to QuoteBar.Reader() error message

* Incorrect timezone specified on consolidator filter

The margin call model has been refactored and now contains both methods for margin call order handling (generation and execution).

Disabling margin calls is now much simpler:
Portfolio.MarginCallModel = MarginCallModel.Null;

List of changes:
- Added a new IMarginCallModel interface
- Renamed MarginCallModel to DefaultMarginCallModel
- Refactored margin call models by moving the GenerateMarginCallOrder method from ISecurityMarginModel to IMarginCallModel
- Disabled margin calls by default for live trading in BrokerageSetupHandler initialization

Working orders (limit or stop) are usually cancelled by calling the OrderTicket.Cancel() method. This method is asynchronous in both backtesting and live, so reading the OrderStatus immediately after the Cancel call, can result in different values seen over different runs.

The solution introduces a new CancelPending value to the OrderStatus enum and guarantees that the order will have this status when the Cancel method returns (unless there was an error earlier, such as invalid order id). This status is meant to be temporary and will be overwritten/replaced by the Canceled value after the brokerage has completed the cancel operation.

the consolidation period before firing the consolidated event. This
introduces a lag in the results. We've mostly gotten around this  for
the most common case through usage of the IdentityConsolidator.

The issue arises when considering fill forward behavior and subscriptions
with different resolutions.

Consider a Minute subscription a Daily subscription. Default behavior will
fill forward that daily bar on every minute. If your indicator is based on
the IdentityConsolidator, then it will receive the same price update for
each minute the security trades that day.

By scanning the consolidators based on time, the consolidator is able to
determine that it is indeed time for it to emit a new consolidated bar.
This removes the need for the IdentityConsolidator while also fixing the
aforementioned bug.

* Renamed tests for Api to ApiTests

* Renamed Live to LiveAlgorithm

* Add LiveAlgorithm configuration classes for supported brokerages

The QuantConnect api v2 enables users to launch live algorithms with one of the supported brokerages. The LiveAlgorithmSettings class adds brokerage specific configuration classes that will allow algorithms to be configured to run live on a specific brokerage.

* Projects can now be updated via the Api v2

* Projects can be created via the Api with LiveAlgorithmSettings class

* Renamed CreateLive to CreateLiveAlgorithm in IApi

* Added tests for luanching live algorithms via api V2 for brokerages

* Created ProjectUpdateResponse to represent api response when project is updated

The new class ProjectUpdateResponse derives from RestReponse and adds a field, Files, that represents the project files associated with a project.   This new class is now what the Api method returns.  A new test, Update_ProjectFiles_Successfully, tests updating the files for a project via the Api

* Refactored ApiTests and expanded ApiTest docs

* Renamed brokerage specific classes that derive from BaseLiveAlgorithmSettings

* Refactored Oanda and Tradier LiveAlgorithm settings

Tradier and Oanda do not required certain parameters like password and username to trade live, however, they are required for the QC Api v2.  A new constructor was added to BaseLiveAlgorithmSettings that does not take in these parameters and sets the unneeded parameters to blank strings.  Tradier and Oanda LiveAlgorithmSettings  implement this new constructor.

* Minor tweaks to OandaLiveAlgorithmSettings

* Brokerage Api tests now use appropriate algorithms

Some brokerage tests were using algorithms that traded securities that did not pertain to the brokerage.  This has been corrected.

* Refactored naming of certain Api methods to be more consistent

* Added extra parameters to Api method ListLiveAlgorithms

* Added class that represents chart data from ""live/read"" api endpoint

* Minor change to LiveAlgorithmResults

* Version is now an optional parameter for LiveAlgorithmApiSettingsWrapper

* Minor formatting changes to long method signatures in Api.cs

* IApi now accepts versionId for CreateLiveAlgorithm

* Removed BrokerageName from LiveAlgorithmSettings.

* Fixed spelling mistake

* Added custom JsonConverter for LiveAlgorithmResults

In order to properly deserialize the results of an algorithm from the api endpoint ""live/read"", a custom deserializer is added to deal with null ChartPoints.  In order to deserialize ChartPoints that are null, ChartPoint has been changed from a struct to a class.

* Fixed type-o in ApiTests

* Add Ignore NUnit attribute to ApiTests

* Removed ApiAlgorithmStatus

In order to better align with the rest of the project, ApiAlgorithmStatus has been replaced by the existing AlgorithmStatus enum.  Only certain values of AlgorithmStatus can be used with the Api.  Unsuported values throw an ArgumentException error.

* Changed Resolution field in LiveAlgorithmResults from string to enum

* BrokerageEnvironment enum added to represent live/paper trading

* Environment set based on user in InteractiveBrokersLiveAlgorithmSettings

* Minor tweaks to BaseLiveAlgorithmSettings constructor

* Environment is hard coded for TradierLiveAlgorithmSettings

* Updated ApiTests to reflect changes to LiveAlgorithmSettings

* ApiConnection uses OrderJsonConverter to deserialize orders

* AlgorithmStatus is now nullable for ListLiveAlgorithms

* Tweaked account variable for InteractiveBrokersLiveAlgorithmSettings

* Replaced null comparisons with call to HasValue for LiveAlgo status

  GetSubscriptionRequestsUniverseDecorator
    Allows functional substitution of the GetSubscriptionRequests impl
  SelectSymbolsUniverseDecorator:
    Allows functional substituion of the SelectSymbols impl

This allows us to compose universes that can modify symbol selection and
subscription request behaviors which is all that's needed to chain
universes together.

For example, consider the case with coarse fundamental and fine fundamental.
  We'll configure coarse to return fine subscription requests and configure
  fine to prefilter its data to only allow those that were also selected by
  coarse.

FileSystemDataFeed and the LiveTradingDataFeed. The former works using enumerators
and a time sync loop that uses the concept of a frontier to decide when to 'pull-off'
data that's at or before the frontier. This makes the feed uninterested in how the
data (via enumerators) is provided, and only concerns itself with things at the
subscription level, that is, time syncing and universe selection invocation.

These concepts were brought over to the LiveTradingDataFeed with some modification.
This change heavily uses object composition of enumerators to handle the various
concerns that were previously within the enumerator loops in the LiveTradingDataFeed.

Some enumerator types that help accomplish these concerns:

	FastForwardEnumerator 		- fast forwards an enumerator that contains old data
	RateLimitEnumerator			- prevents an enumerator from being invoked too frequently
	TradeBarBuilderEnumerator 	- Builds trade bars from tick data
	FrontierAwareEnumerator		- Emits the underlying when the frontier is on or after Current
	EnqueableEnumerator			- Acts as a liason between a push/pull system using a queue

	* Data feeds are required to time sync in UTC time
	* TimeSlice.Time is now in UTC

IAlgorithm
	* Time is now exclusively the algorithm's local time zone
	* Added UtcTime
	* SetDateTime( DateTime ) accepts a UTC time and is internally converted

SubscriptionDataConfig
	* Adds market and time zone as required ctor parameters

SecurityExchange
	* Now passes most calls directly through to SecurityExchangeHours class

SecurityExchangeHours
	* Holds market hours for each day of week (LocalMarketHours)
	* Talks in terms of local times in the SecurityExchangeHours.TimeZone time zone

Data/market-hours/
	* New data folder to hold market hour information
	* Includes market-hours-database.csv to hold market hours per market/symbol/security (see doc in file)
	* Includes holidays-usa.csv to hold holidays for 'usa' market
		+ The holiday files follow the pattern 'holidays-*.csv' where * is the market

TimeKeeper
	* Receives updates in UTC time
	* Passes that to LocalTimeKeeper's who lazily evaluate the time in their respective time zones
	* Eventually this can grow to be the sole source of time in the algorithm's scope

MISC:
	* Fixes exception thrown when exiting LiveTradingDataFeed
	* Fixes exception thrown when exiting FileSystemDataFeed
	* Fixes exception thrown when exiting StatusPing
	* Simplify FillForwardEnumerator logic with GetNextMarketOpen
	* Adds many time zones, see TimeZones.cs

	- IDataFeed now responsible for all time syncing, DataStream was removed
	- BlockingCollection allows for easy throttling of data feed thread without sleeps (internally using semaphore slim)
	- Slimmed down IDataFeed interface to not include members unused externally

DataFeeds now use raw IEnumerator<BaseData> instead of subscription data readers directly
	- Simplifies fill forward logic (see FillForwardEnumerator.cs and FillForwardEnumeratorTest.cs)
	- Allows for composition (raw reader -> fill forward, user/market filters)
	- SubscriptionDataReader now handles refreshing source (continuous enumeration)

LiveTradingDataFeed cleaned up to work with time slice bridge
	- RealTimeSynchronizedTimer handles pushing time slices into bridge every second, with or without data
	- Subscriptions with tick resolution get their data pushed directly into the bridge immediately

Fill forward changes
	- Implemented as an IEnumerator<BaseData>
	- Fill forward lower res on higher res (daily gets filled forward on second/minute/hour bars)
	- Second/minute/hour will not be filled forward on daily bars (at midnight) in line with current behavior

MISC:
	- Performance boost in backtesting brokerage via not checking _pending.Count, instead use local bool to determine if there's pending orders
	- Added a FakeDataQueue to aid in testing LiveTradingDataFeed
	- FileSystemDataFeed now uses CancellationTokenSource to handle thread exits
	- Added logging
