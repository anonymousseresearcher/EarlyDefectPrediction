Unified several queues into one segmented FIFO queue. This will enable us to add several levels of priority.

* Introducing exclusion priority

* ""excludedLeak"" is now known as ""won't fix leak"", which matches its reality better. It's a leak that is known and real yet we're not fixing.
* Exclusion.alwaysExclude is replaced with Exclusion.status, with 3 possible values: NEVER_REACHABLE, WONT_FIX_LEAK, WEAKLY_REACHABLE.
* The shortest path finder will now follow weak references after all other paths have been exhausted.
* Removed class exclusion, was confusing, replaced with less lazy approach of listing fields to exclude
* VIEWLOCATIONHOLDER_ROOT should not have been always excluded, fixed.

Fixes #1173 ... well kinda. Instead of ""non leaking retained instances"", LeakCanary will report weakly reachable traces. Not sure if that'll help but it's a foundation we can build on.

This meant that if the process died (e.g. crash) during an analysis, no heap dumps would happen in the next 10 minutes.

Heap analysis is now fast, it finds many leaks at once, it's serial and in a single process. This means we can remove this behavior and just dump the heap whenever thresholds are met and then enqueue work to the serial service.

If the process is killed during an analysis, it won't resume but it's easy enough to import the hprof again, from the sd card.

This only worked pre M because we looked at mBuffer which went away. The updated perflib looks up in native land and updates the Bitmap objects to the correct native size. This change means we now get the exact same retained size in Android Studio & LeakCanary. Unless we build our own heap dump parser, it's probably better to just rely on perflib for retained size.
* HAHA now ignores missing native threads instead of creating an empty snapshot.
* HAHA 2.1 has Java 8 bytecode, which means LeakCanary consumers are now expected to support Java 8 bytecode. This is a breaking change that will go in a 2.0 release.

- If KeyedWeakReference.key is null (which should never happen at runtime), then we skip and keep looking for keys, but report all the null keys if we couldn't find any.

If this was caused by some malformed object then we have a chance of actually finding the right KeyedWeakReference instance. However, if this was caused by a heap dump parsing issue then we'll
still crash but at least we'll have an exception closer to the source.

- We shouldn't remove the fragment lifecycle callback on activity destroy: it's automatically removed and the activity destroy callback happens before the fragment destroy.
- Added configuration for watching fragments directly on AndroidRefWatcherBuilder
- Moved ActivityRefWatcher to the internal package, it shouldn't have been an API. This is a breaking change, but should have a small impact (it's easy to recreate this class and tailor it to ones's needs)
- New `leakcanary-support-fragment` module to watch support fragments.
- Watching Fragments is enabled by default (can be disabled). If enabled, it'll automatically watch native Fragments on Android O and it'll watch support fragments if the `leakcanary-support-fragment` dependency is in the classpath.
- Added instrumentation tests, which led to finding bugs and fixing them.

This change:

- Isolates the leak detection code for instrumentation tests in InstrumentationLeakDetector
- Creates FailTestOnLeakRunListener which fails any individual instrumentation test that introduces a leak.
- Updates the Travis configuration to be able to run instrumentation tests in LeakCanary PRs.
- Adds an instrumentation test that runs InstrumentationLeakDetector and makes sure a leak is detected (InstrumentationLeakDetectorTest).
- Adds a failing instrumentation test to the sample app, TuPeuxPasTest. This test will not run in CI (it fails, on purpose), but can be run locally.
- Switches the background work in MainActivity from an AsyncTask to a Thread because instrumentation tests wait for AsyncTask to complete before finishing.
- Adds a new method to the API: RefWatcher.clearWatchedReferences().

We create a distinct ""pending"" hprof for each heap dump, and those are cleaned up as part of the hprof file rotation.
* If a pending hprof hasn't been removed in 10 minutes, LeakCanary now assumes no analysis is in progress, and starts dumping the heap again.
* We now use the app directory as a fallback if the external storage directory isn't available. This is transparent to the user.
* If the external storage permission isn't granted, we show the notification as before but we also immediately fallback to the app directory, so that leak isn't lost.
* Leak notifications now each use a distinct notification instead of erasing each other.
* If LeakCanary can't perform a heap dump for any reason (e.g. analysis in progress, debugger attached ), it retries later with an exponential backoff.

* AnalysisResult.failure is now a `Throwable` instead of an `Exception`. Main goal is to catch and correctly report OOMs while parsing.
* Added ARRAY_ENTRY to LeakTraceElement.Type for references through array entries.
* Huge speed improvements when performing the shortest path with excluded references: it's now tailored to our needs instead of doing it on a loop.
* Renamed `ExcludedRefs` fields.
* Each `ExcludedRef` entry can now be ignored entirely or ""kept only if no other path"".
* Added support for ignoring all fields (static and non static) for a given class.
* Improved the heap dump analyzer test and added a heap dump for M Preview 2.
* Bumped version to 1.4-SNAPSHOT because this breaks the APIs.
